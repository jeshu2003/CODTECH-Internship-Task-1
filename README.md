## Introduction
The **Scientific Calculator** is a Python-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for performing various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, calculus (derivatives and integrals), and matrix operations. Built using the Tkinter library, the application aims to make complex calculations accessible to users of all levels.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Relational Expressions**: Evaluate and compare expressions using relational operators (e.g., `<`, `>`, `==`, etc.).
- **Calculus Functions**: Compute derivatives and integrals of functions.
- **Matrix Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion of matrices.
- **Scrollable Text Output**: Displays results in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to scroll through their calculation history.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI designed for ease of use.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Tkinter**: A built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.
- **SymPy**: A Python library for symbolic mathematics, used for evaluating expressions, derivatives, and integrals.
- **Regex**: Used for parsing and handling relational expressions.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd scientific-calculator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   You may need to install the required libraries if they are not already available. Use pip to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install sympy
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is set up, you can start using the calculator by running the script. Enter your mathematical expressions or commands in the input field, and click the corresponding buttons to perform calculations.

## How to Run the Application
To run the Scientific Calculator, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Functionality
### Basic Operations
- Input a mathematical expression and press the "Calculate" button to get the result.

### Derivative Calculation
- Enter a function and press the "Derivative" button to compute its derivative.

### Integral Calculation
- Enter a function and press the "Integral" button to compute its integral.

### Matrix Operations
- Access the Matrix Operations window to input matrices and perform various operations.

### Relational Expressions
- Enter relational expressions to compare two values.

## Examples
- **Basic Calculation**: Input `3 + 5` → Output: `8`
- **Derivative**: Input `x**2` → Output: `2*x`
- **Integral**: Input `x**2` → Output: `(1/3)*x**3 + C`
- **Matrix Input**: 
    ```
    1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9
    ```
